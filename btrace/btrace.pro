# XXX: Perhaps libbtrace should be installed into a library directory, but then
# the btrace.sh has to locate the library somehow.  Perhaps it could look in
# ../lib.  Perhaps we could write a path into btrace.sh somehow at
# install-time?  Assuming there is a configurable --libdir/LIBDIR setting, the
# library will be placed into $(INSTALL_ROOT)/$$LIBDIR, but INSTALL_ROOT isn't
# know at qmake-time.  Perhaps we could forbid the use of INSTALL_ROOT.  I
# think the point of having separately-configurable BINDIR and LIBDIR options
# is to deal with multiarch systems.
#
# On a related subject, we need to consider how this LD_PRELOAD technique works
# on a 64-bit system where 32-bit processes run during the build.  I think the
# dynamic linker prints an error message when it sees the incompatible
# LD_PRELOAD library, but then continues running.  Apparently some versions of
# the dynamic linker recognize a magic '$LIB' string (like '$ORIGIN') and turn
# it into lib or lib64, but again, what about Debian multiarch systems?
# Another idea is to alter LD_PRELOAD inside libbtrace's exec wrappers
# depending upon the bit-ness of the program being exec'ed.  (It's possible to
# exec non-ELF images, though, like shebang, Win32, or Mono executables.)
